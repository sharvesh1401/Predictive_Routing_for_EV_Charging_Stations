# üîí Security Checklist for EV Routing Simulation

## Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### ‚úÖ Environment Variables
- [ ] **API Keys Secured**: All API keys are stored as environment variables
- [ ] **No Hardcoded Keys**: No API keys are committed to version control
- [ ] **Environment File**: `.env.local` is properly configured and not committed
- [ ] **Production Variables**: Production environment variables are set securely

### ‚úÖ API Key Management
- [ ] **Mapbox Token**: Valid Mapbox API token configured
- [ ] **DeepSeek Key**: Valid DeepSeek API key configured
- [ ] **Groq Key**: Valid Groq API key configured
- [ ] **Key Rotation**: API keys are rotated regularly (recommended: every 90 days)

### ‚úÖ Deployment Security
- [ ] **HTTPS Enabled**: Application is served over HTTPS
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Security headers are properly configured
- [ ] **CORS Settings**: CORS is configured for allowed origins only
- [ ] **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers are implemented

### ‚úÖ Code Security
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] **XSS Protection**: No innerHTML usage with unsanitized data
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens are implemented
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting is enabled

## Post-Deployment Security Checklist

### ‚úÖ Monitoring
- [ ] **Security Monitoring**: Security monitoring is active
- [ ] **Error Logging**: Error logs are being collected
- [ ] **API Usage**: API key usage is being monitored
- [ ] **Performance**: Application performance is being tracked

### ‚úÖ Access Control
- [ ] **User Authentication**: User authentication is implemented (if required)
- [ ] **Authorization**: Proper authorization checks are in place
- [ ] **Session Management**: Sessions are properly managed
- [ ] **Logout Functionality**: Secure logout is implemented

### ‚úÖ Data Protection
- [ ] **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] **Data Transmission**: Data is encrypted in transit
- [ ] **Data Retention**: Data retention policies are implemented
- [ ] **Data Backup**: Secure data backup is configured

## Security Best Practices

### üîê API Key Security
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Use environment variables
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_actual_token

# ‚ùå Bad: Hardcoded in source code
const token = "pk.eyJ1IjoieW91cnVzZXJuYW1lIiwiYSI6ImNrZXhhbXBsZSJ9";
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Sanitize user input
const sanitizedInput = sanitizeInput(userInput);

// ‚ùå Bad: Use unsanitized input directly
element.innerHTML = userInput;
```

### üîí Secure Communication
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Use HTTPS
const apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com';

// ‚ùå Bad: Use HTTP
const apiUrl = 'http://api.example.com';
```

## Security Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Security Status**: Check the security status indicator in the app
- **API Key Health**: Monitor API key validation status
- **Rate Limit Status**: Check rate limiting compliance
- **Error Logs**: Review security-related error logs

### Regular Security Audits
- **Monthly**: Review API key usage and rotate if necessary
- **Quarterly**: Conduct security vulnerability assessments
- **Annually**: Perform comprehensive security audits

## Emergency Response

### If API Keys are Compromised
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Rotate the compromised API key immediately
   - Update environment variables in all deployment environments
   - Review access logs for suspicious activity
   - Notify relevant stakeholders

2. **Investigation**:
   - Check version control history for exposed keys
   - Review deployment logs for key exposure
   - Analyze API usage patterns for abuse

3. **Prevention**:
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Update security policies and procedures
   - Conduct security training for team members
