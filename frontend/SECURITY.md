# 🔒 Security Documentation

## Overview

This application implements **maximum security measures** to protect sensitive data, especially API keys. All security features are designed to meet enterprise-grade standards and comply with industry best practices.

## 🔐 API Key Security

### **Environment Variables**
API keys are stored securely using environment variables and are **never hardcoded** in the source code.

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
REACT_APP_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### **Encryption**
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Derivation**: 100,000 iterations
- **Salt Length**: 32 bytes
- **IV Length**: 16 bytes

### **Storage Security**
- API keys are encrypted before storage
- Keys are stored in encrypted local storage
- Automatic key rotation capabilities
- Usage tracking and monitoring

## 🛡️ Security Features

### **1. Input Validation & Sanitization**
